    <h2>
        1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page
    </h2>
    <p>
        Each page is broken up into the different sections relevant to our coursework assignment. the
        home-page/"aboutme" is assigned to the index so it is the 1st thing you see when you load into the website. The
        background for each page is the same, a circuitboard image taken from border art of "apnews.com". The second
        link "webdesign" are the steps, tools and processes that went into designing the initial website.

    <h2>
        1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites
    </h2>
    <p>
        Copyright is the exclusive and assignable legal right, to reproduce the work, usually with the grounds to make a
        profit from the subject. This right is not absolute but is usually considered to be binding. Copyrights can be
        granted by public law and are in that case considered "territorial rights". This means that
        copyrights granted by the law of a certain state, do not extend outside of that territory influence.
<br>
<br>
        For thE purpose of this work, the relevence of Copyright with creative work is significant to course grading.
        Whilst something like wikipedia is an open platform, that anyone can add to; the information added is considered
        to be factual, for the purposes of referencing it. Citations must be used for anymore than 10% of someone else's
        work, re-used in your own projects, must be cited as a reference, otherwise the work will be considered plagiarised and
        the examining body will fail the student.

    <h2>
        1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may
        face when using webpages and how we can overcome them
    </h2>
    <p>
        A major issue that would arise with a website design is, if it needs to be accessible is those with visual
        impairments. Whilst it will be possible to write in the code to make a website accessible to impaired users of
        any type; normally the device they are accessing your site with will usually have the features to allow them to,
        already. This is just as well, as coding a website specifically for a disability is way beyond my coding skill.
    </p>
    <h2>
        1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites
    </h2>
    <p>
        html is obviously the primary filetype for webdesign as that is the format that a piece of software like VSCode
        will recognise as a website design. For further uploads necessary to the website images are best kept in the .jpeg or
        .png format as they are universally recognised. Finally hyperlinks need to be correctly typed up otherwise a
        link will not be formed between the link and the intended site.
