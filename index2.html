    <h2>
        1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites
    </h2>
    <p>
    html is obviously the primary filetype for webdesign as that is the format that a piece of software like VSCode will
    recognise as a website design. For further uploads necessary to the website images are best kept in the .jpeg or
    .png format as they are universally recognised. Finally hyperlinks need to be correctly typed up otherwise a link
    will not be formed between the link and the intended site.
