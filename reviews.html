        2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed– in making your own website, are you happy
        with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello
    </h2>
    <p>
        A major issue that was discovered with the Visual Studio Code was that there was translating issues in my
        coding. Even though my experience with website design was very limited before starting the course, i have
        nevertheless wanted to apply coding and content more complex than my ability to code. Also when you’re reaching
        300 lines of code, it becomes very problematic when one “.” or "p” element, out of place, can suddenly stop
        everything from working.
            <br>
            <br>
            Trello is a useful tool for monitoring your progress throughout a project as intended, though can equally
            prove a very daunting tool, if you have a very short deadline for a project, with many small tasks assigned
            to the 1st “needs doing” bar, set up.
            <br>
            <br>
            Slack whilst not heavily used, since this is a solo project, has been useful to get the occasional bit of
            useful code sent over to me by the instructor without having it dictated to me, etc. Moodle however has been
            instrumental, as a lot of the tasks we have been trying to apply to our websites are brand new techniques
            for us, so we’ve been learning as we go.

            2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate (e.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello)
        </h2>
        <p>
            One additional thing that I found useful, not originally listed with the software I was using, is Dcode.
            When searching for a portable version of the VSCode software to use on my phone, this app was what appeared
            in the search results. The mini version of the vscode architecture was very useful in providing a quick and
            simple guide to reference against when trying to determine errors and “coding order” for html commands
            written in VSCode
        </p>

            2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why
            not? What would you change?
        </h2>
        <p>
            The website works, which is as good as can be expected at this stage, There are a few issues I have with it
            and features I would’ve liked to put in, but alas with the time constraints and lack of experience, I would
            fail to meet the deadline, if I tried to implement them in the coding. Originally I had intednded to use a
            background that would've made the text look hard to read in anything other than bright red, which i feel
            would've looked tacky and garish. The idea would've been to use a light grey border for the body of text.
            The text-box would've been semi-transparent and allowed black text be written in those boxes, however
            despite several different attempts, re-edits and 1 "restart from previous save-filer", the text boxes
            couldn't be reliably coded over the background image.
            <br>
            <img src="egtextbox.png" width="900" height="400">
            <br>
            <br>
            As the example above shows, i was successful in getting the text box to show as grey, but the areas it coded
            and the margin/parameters as well as the sections of text it was displaying for could not be assured.
            Suffice to say too much time was being wasted trying to fix this problem than should've been, which
            jeapordised the time i had avaulable to complete the content for the site
        </p>

        <h2>
            2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project
        </h2>
        <p>
            Further improvements would be improving the volume of content, better editing and attempts of coding, to
            provide
            my final website with a more streamlined, succinct progression. I find this quickly comes with experience
            and
            confidence as by the last day of this project i am more confident and implementing my answers and references
            in
            as code.

                <p>
                    The table above gives a good example of how i would properly test my website given an ideal timeframe, the internal links between pages have been accurately coded so the pathways go to the correct. Unfortunately when i have copied some of the website links and stored them to use as links later (Trello/Kanban and Moodle images), an error appears to have occured and the links do not work. My final test would be to give the website to a non-"tech savvy" friend or one i know is tech-savvy but is obtuse and likely to find any mistakes in the code i missed.

                <p>
                    The answer to a question like this is nearly always going to be yes; in this case the obvious
                    factors that would have improved efficiency in both the website’s design as well as the time in
                    which it got
                    coded, is experience. With more experience in the subject matter I would have been faster writing up
                    the
                    answer and wouldn’t have had so many code-issues that needed troubleshooting.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    1 major drawback for me personally when designing this website is a particular dislike for the
                    Apple/IOS interface and nearly 25years of using a windows (...well DOS originally, but we won’t go
                    there) PC,
                    meaning it has been an initial learning challenge to familiarise myself with the device, before
                    being able
                    to do any kind of coding on it.

                    <br>
                    Working in teams would have presented new issues to overcome, as it introduces difference of styles
                    in both aesthetic and writing of code. As VSCode has shown to be very specific how it translates
                    commands,
                    functions etc, based on the order it is prioritised, it could cause major errors to occur if
                    different coders
                    were to try and compile their separate workings into a final product. To ensure success, a constant
                    would
                    have to be set prior to the start of the project

                <p>
                    I personally would have been more efficient working in a different environment to the one i have
                    done for
                    the production of this project. Due to daily medication I must take, which raises my metabolism/body
                    temperature, i am not able to function in particularly warm work-conditions, such as the office
                    block that
                    we had to.

                    <br>
                    From this project I have noted that there have been others who equally struggled in the heat during
                    the
                    summer conditions. From my personal experiences, I would surmise that the productivity and focus of
                    the
                    whole coding team would drastically improve, when they are comfortable in their workspace.

                <p>
                    For the aforesaid reasons i feel that if teamwork was goihg to be included in the project then the
                    best way
                    to implement it, would have been to compile the data to be added to the site as a group, share
                    information
                    and ideas over slack and write content up on something like google.docs, which is a generic
                    writing-platform
                    accessible from any device. When all the data is shared and compiled, i'd have it sent to one team
                    member in
                    order to code it, (as guaranteeing a standardised coding style across multiple group member's
                    contribution
                    is hard to ensure).

                <p>
                    Since googling "testing digital solutions" brings up a list of sites and companies which are focused
                    specifically to do the job. For an amateur site, meant for a course project, like this; i would most
                    likely get a test group from my coursemates and then do a more generalised audience to test it out.
                    I find the more inexperienced or "obtuse" a test-user is, the more likely they are to find a flaw in
                    what was considered a "fool-proof project"
