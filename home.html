        Oh how I hate writing these, but here we go, My life and career history seems to revolve around the
        concept of jack of all trades, with no solid idea of where I want to go in life, After studying for
        microbiology at university, my work experience has since included; from stacking shelves, to wiring up the
        lighting on the back-deck of a seismic exploration vessel. The latter profession, for CGG Veritas 
        (originally an acronym for Compagnie Générale de Géophysique), want probably the most thrilling and
        full-filling career as it allowed to learn totally new systems for the acquisition of data, using Linux,
        as well as the deployment and maintenance of highly specific recording software.

        I try to maintain a demeanor and attitude in life, of the “educated fool”. There is always more to
        learn, what would’ve been taken for witchcraft 100 years ago, was impossible science 30 years ago, is taken for
        granted now. The stupid always have plenty more to learn, whereas the expert learns nothing. At 31 i am 
        still trying to find the right niche to settle down in with a career. I have a very high work ethic, but
        feel i need to find a subject that i have a passion for, which proves both manageable yet challenging
