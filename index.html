<p>Oh how I hate writing these, but here we go, My life and career history seems to revolve around the concept of jack of all trades, with no solid idea of where I want to go in life, After studying for microbiology at university, my work experience has included from stacking shelves, to wiring up the lighting on the back-deck of a seismic exploration vessel  The latter profession, for CGG Veritas, was probably the most thrilling and full-filling experience as it allowed to learn totally new systems for the acquisition of data, using Linux, as well as the deployment and maintenance of highly specific recording software. 
</p>

<p>I try to maintain a demeanor and attitude in life, of the “educated fool”. There is always more to learn, what would’ve been taken for witchcraft 100 years ago, was impossible science 30 years ago, is taken for granted now. The stupid always have plenty more to learn, whereas the expert learns nothing.

1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business
In the modern world, a highly capable IT team is the lifeblood of all businesses,  no matter the size or sector, having an IT team that is well-trained is crucial to keeping businesses afloat. Their many responsibilities are integral, even if the company takes for granted the importance of the role.
IT teams are responsible for generating, optimising and maintaining the various communication channels of an organisation, as well as providing those systems with the necessary levels of security. Given how damaging a data breach can be for a business and their reputation, a lot of trust has to be given to an IT team to take preventative measures.
The move to digital data storage rather than the “archives of paper” for storage of even the last 2 years worth of paperwork, means a lot of sensitive data is now kept in an online cloud or digital server. A good IT team has the skills to make sure that additional stock can automatically be ordered when necessary, or manually place them through the system, ideally allowing a reliable connection between inventory management system with your POS system.
Most importantly, your IT team has the capacity to compare your achievements, sales, losses and much more against other branches of your own business or against its direct competitors. If you want to keep up a good rivalry for a particular niche of the market, then the ability to cross reference the information across various databases can give very specific identification of where you are having issues or striving. 
1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully 

So for a digital project to be most successful, with all the team member’s skillsets utilised to their fullest, you need some form of project management tool, to assign the tasks amongst the group. A communication tool is needed to relay data, progress and troubleshoot issues quickly between a group, especially if the team isn’t all located at the same onsite R&D facility. Furthermore if the content of a project is brand new and the future “standard” is actually being established alongside the progress of the project, this enables teaching courses to be generated for teaching these to other team members.

The rest of the needed resources are relevant to the project in question. XCode for example is likely a must, when designing an app for IOS. The ideal software to create and code a project would likely be decided on before, the start of a project 


1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT. e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your trello board.

The designing of the website is going to be done on “Visual Studio Code” to write out the html (and later the css code), for the website information. The reason for this primarily is the software is multi-platform and allows me to continue coding my coursework outside of the classroom, using a windows PC, as well as the provided macbooks we’ve used for the duration of the course

1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?
A lot of the time. What makes a website fail is not adhering to laws and regulations imposed by another company/website or the GDPR. Digital service providers may encounter big financial sanctions for GDPR infringements that might greatly impact their businesses or even force them to close all together.

Other than that it could be that one digital project, competing for the same market, out-does another, whether it be because of lower prices or better services than their competitors. Amazon is a good example of this, where the service Alexa provides, plus the already existent low prices of the store, makes a synergy that encourages people to choose their brand over competitors 


1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software -  how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?

Trello (Kanban)
(Image 2)
All you have to do is define the stages of your workflow, then setup a way to move each task from one stage to the other. In a factory, you might have different boxes or shelves for each stage: raw materials in the first, half-made parts in the second, and completed parts in the third. For other projects, you might have a card—whether a note in a program, or a physical piece of paper on a board—where you list info about a task, and you'll move that card to different lists as the task progresses.
<ul>
<li>
Cards (Kanban translates to "visual card"): Each task has a card that includes all relevant info about it; this makes sure everything to complete the tasks is always at hand.
</li>
<li>
Cap on work in progress: Limit how many cards are in play at once; this prevents teams from over-committing.
Constant improvement (otherwise known as "kaizen"): Analyze the flow to determine how efficiently you're working, and always strive to improve it.
</li>
<li>    
it's designed for highly cohesive teams, that are self-motivated and don't need as much management or deadlines. It's great for those who lean toward seeing the entire project at a glance. If you're careful to follow Kanban rules and only assign as much work as a team can handle, projects are less likely to go past deadline and team members are less likely to juggle other distractions. Finally because the product owner can change tasks that aren't currently being worked on along the way, it allows for flexibility without frustration.
</li>
<li>
However a weakness in the system is If only one of your team members has a certain in-demand skill, the individual can hold up everything. Kanban is ideal for teams that have members with overlapping skills, so that everyone can pitch in and help move the backlog list to zero. It's also best for places where time on the overall project isn't quite as crucial; if you must ship by certain deadlines, TPM or Scrum give you the time management structure you need.

</ul>
  
Slack
Slack offers many IRC-like features, including persistent chat rooms (channels) organized by topic, private groups, and direct messaging. Content, including files, conversations, and people, is all searchable within Slack. Users can add emoji buttons to their messages, on which other users can then click to express their reactions to messages. Slack's free plan allows only  the 10,000 most recent messages to be viewed and searched. Slack teams allow communities, groups, or teams to join a "workspace" via a specific URL or invitation sent by a team admin or owner. Although Slack was developed for organizational communication, it has been adopted as a community platform, replacing message boards or social media such as Facebook or LinkedIn groups
 
Public channels allow team members to communicate without the use of email or group SMS (texting). Public channels are open to everyone in the workspace.
Private channels allow for private conversation between smaller sub-groups. These private channels can be used to organize large teams.
Direct messages allow users to send private messages to specific users rather than a group of people. Direct messages can include up to nine people. Once started, a direct message group can be converted into a private channel.
 
Slack integrates with many third-party services and also supports community-built integrations. Major integrations include services such as Google Drive, Trello, Dropbox, Box, Heroku, IBM Bluemix, Crashlytics, GitHub, Runscope, Zendesk and Zapier. In December 2015, Slack launched their software application ("app") directory, consisting of over 150 integrations that users can install

Moodle
Moodle enables you to design and build courses to cater for virtually any type of learning preference with its Interactive Authoring Tool. For projects that are “cutting edge” a project leader can create engaging lessons and courses on a specific subject, with tools for collaboration, assessment, communication and eLearning content within the group.


Build competency frameworks, link to course completion and assign to personal learning plans. It is then much easier to generate the relevant measures achievement that aligns with your teams’ knowledge and skill requirements. Project leaders can even recognise these achievements, as well as motivate other team members, still learning, by issuing certificates and Open Badges.

 

1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects– How does GDPR impact digital projects?
 
Article 29 Data Protection Working Party
The Article 29 Working Party is an advisory body set up under the Data Privacy Directive 95/46/EC. It is composed of a list of representatives for the national data protection authorities (DPA), the EDPS and the European Commission. Its primary role is to best advise the Commission on general data protection along with any relevant EU laws that may affect data privacy. It also promotes the uniform application of the Data Protection Directive across the entire EU.
 
European Data Protection Supervisor
The European Data Protection Supervisor is the independent supervisory authority set up in 2014 by the Parliament and Council to advise EU administrations on the processing of personal data as well as supervising these bodies to ensure compliance to their own regulations. The EDPS also handles complaints and monitors new technologies related to the processing of personal data.

The main, most severe consequence of non-compliance with GDPR is facing administrative fines of up to EUR 20,000,000 or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. That may cause a real harm for both small and large-size companies.

The media usually bring up only these huge financial fines as a consequence of non-compliance with the GDPR, but the legislation gives supervisory authorities of the EU member states a range of other powers that may severely impact IT-focused businesses. These may for example include forcing controllers or processors to take specific actions within specific timelines in order to comply with GDPR rules, imposing a temporary or definitive limitation of processing, or even outright banning it.

The GDPR doesn’t only mean new obligations and expenses, it also offers a bevy of new business opportunities. Under the GDPR, terms and conditions of providing services for users located in the EU will no longer depend on the location of the service provider. This means that businesses in the EU and outside the Union’s borders will compete and operate on the same level.
