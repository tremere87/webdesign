            Oh how I hate writing these, but here we go, My life and career history seems to revolve around the
            concept of jack of all trades, with no solid idea of where I want to go in life, After studying for
            microbiology at university, my work experience has since included; from stacking shelves, to wiring up the
            lighting on the back-deck of a seismic exploration vessel. The latter profession, for CGG Veritas
            (originally an acronym for Compagnie Générale de Géophysique), want probably the most thrilling and
            full-filling career as it allowed to learn totally new systems for the acquisition of data, using Linux,
            as well as the deployment and maintenance of highly specific recording software.
            <br>
            <br>
            I try to maintain a demeanor and attitude in life, of the “educated fool”. There is always more to
            learn, what would’ve been taken for witchcraft 100 years ago, was impossible science 30 years ago, is taken
            for
            granted now. The stupid always have plenty more to learn, whereas the expert learns nothing. At 31 i am
            still trying to find the right niche to settle down in with a career. I have a very high work ethic, but
            feel i need to find a subject that i have a passion for, which proves both manageable yet challenging.
            <br>
            <br>
            I am currently trying to expand my knowledge even further, whilst between jobs, to allow me further
            eligibility for new and upcoming jobs that will become available within Manchester over the next few years.
            This i am currently intending to do on the CodeNation, Coding and Cyber-Security courses
